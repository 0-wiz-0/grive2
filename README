The first version of grive:

This is a very experimental version. It just download all the files in your google drive
in the current directory.

This is compiled in Fedora 16 x64. You need the following libraries to run:
json-c, libcurl, libstdc++

To run it, first run "grive -a", it will print out a URL to the console. Open the URL in
a browser with your google account sign in, and authorize the app. It should display an
authenication code.

Run "grive -c 'auth code here'", the app will display a refresh code. Set this code to
an environment variable:
export GR_REFRESH_CODE='your code here'

Now run "grive" and it will download all your google drive files in the current directory.
