The first version of grive:

This is a very experimental version. It just download all the files in your google drive
in the current directory.

This is compiled in Fedora 16 x64. You need the following libraries to run:
json-c, libcurl, libstdc++ and openssl.

For the first time running grive, you should use the "-a" argument to grant
permission to grive to access to your Google Drive. An URL should be printed.
Go to the page. You will need to login to your google account if you haven't
done so. After granting the permission to grive, the browser will show you
an authenication code. Copy-and-paste that to the standard input of grive.

If everything works fine, grive will create a .grive file in your home directory.
It will also start downloading files from your Google Drive to your current directory.

Enjoy!
